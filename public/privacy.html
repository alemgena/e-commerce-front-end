                As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or
                business offerings. Customers’ information is generally one of
                the transferred business assets in these types of transactions.
                We may also share such information with any affiliated entity
                (e.g. parent company or subsidiary) and may transfer such
                information in the course of a corporate transaction, such as
                the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation,
                or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
